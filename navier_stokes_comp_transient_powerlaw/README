A transient manufactured solution for the compressible Navier--Stokes
equations with a power law viscosity

Documentation:

    writeup.tex: Discussion of the model and the manufactured solution
    soln.py:     Generates C code for the solution and its derivatives
                 Included by writeup.tex
    forcing.c:   Step-by-step details of computing the necessary forcing
                 Included by writeup.tex

Implementation:

    nsctpl.hpp:  C++ header file implementing the manufactured solution
                 No namespaces used to allow #include-ing from other code,
                 possibly within some anonymous namespace.
    main.cpp:    Very simple driver used to ensure nsctpl.hpp compiles
                 at several different precisions and behaves sanely.
    Makefile:    Used to build main.cpp
