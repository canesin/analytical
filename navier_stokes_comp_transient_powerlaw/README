A transient manufactured solution for the compressible Navier--Stokes
equations with a power law viscosity.

Documentation:

    writeup.tex: Discussion of the model and the manufactured solution
    soln.py:     Generates C code for the solution and its derivatives
                 Included by writeup.tex
    forcing.py:  Step-by-step details of computing the necessary forcing
                 Included by writeup.tex

Implementation:

    nsctpl_fwd.hpp:  C++ header file with forward declarations for the
                     manufactured solution.  Code written to allow
                     #include-ing from some other file, possibly within an
                     anonymous namespace.  No double-inclusion guards present.
    nsctpl.hpp:      C++ header file containing templated implementation
                     details for nsctpl.hpp based upon output of running
                     soln.py.  Similar #include comments apply.

Tests:

    test.py:         Using Sympy, computes high precision results for
                     a particular set of solution coefficients.  Results
                     employed in main.cpp.
    main.cpp:        Very simple driver used to ensure nsctpl.hpp compiles
                     at several different precisions and behaves sanely.
                     Checks that ensure C++ implementation matches
                     writeup.tex/soln.py/forcing.py to acceptable tolerance.
    Makefile:        Used to build main.cpp using GNU g++.
