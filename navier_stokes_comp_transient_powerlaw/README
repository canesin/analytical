A transient manufactured solution for the compressible Navier--Stokes
equations with a power law viscosity.

Documentation:

    writeup.tex: Discussion of the model and the manufactured solution
    soln.py:     Generates C code for the solution and its derivatives
                 Included by writeup.tex
    forcing.py:  Step-by-step details of computing the necessary forcing
                 Included by writeup.tex

Implementation:

    nsctpl_fwd.hpp:  C++ header file with forward declarations for the
                     manufactured solution.  Code written to allow
                     #include-ing from some other file, possibly within an
                     anonymous namespace.  No double-inclusion guards present.
    nsctpl.hpp:      C++ header file containing templated implementation
                     details for nsctpl.hpp based upon output of running
                     soln.py.  Similar #include comments apply.

Tests:

    test.py:         Using Sympy, computes high precision results for
                     a particular set of solution coefficients.  Results
                     employed in main.cpp.
    main.cpp:        Very simple driver used to ensure nsctpl.hpp compiles
                     at several different precisions and behaves sanely.
                     Checks that ensure C++ implementation matches
                     writeup.tex/soln.py/forcing.py to acceptable tolerance.
    Makefile:        Used to build main.cpp using GNU g++.

How to use this solution:

    1) Run 'pdflatex writeup.tex' twice to build writeup.pdf.
    2) Review the details of the manufactured solution in writeup.pdf.
    3) Run 'make' to build the binary 'main'.
    4) Execute 'main' and review the output.  This program computes the
       relative error between the C++ implementation (nsctpl_fwd.hpp, nsctpl.hpp)
       and high precision computations done directly from the writeup.pdf
       details (soln.py, forcing.py).  Float-, double-, and long double-based
       computations are shown.
    5) Use nsctpl_fwd.hpp and nsctpl.hpp in your code by #include-ing them
       verbatim into your code.  See the top of nsctpl_fwd.hpp for some
       details.
