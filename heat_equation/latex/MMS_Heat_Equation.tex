\title{Manufactured Solution for Heat Equation using Maple\footnote{Work based on \cite{Kirk2009}.}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document describes the usage of the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) in order to verify codes for the numerical solutions of the Heat Equation. The method consists in including a source term into the original equation in such way that the new modified equation with the source term presents a known analytical solution. In this sense, a manufactured solution is presented for the 1D, 2D and 3D transient and steady heat flow with constant and variable material properties. Source terms for each case are obtained by symbolic manipulation using Maple and presented in this document.
