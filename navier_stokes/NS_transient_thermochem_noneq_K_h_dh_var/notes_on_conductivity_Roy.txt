(10:15:19 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Online would be good
(10:15:25 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Easier for me to chew lunch and type at the same time.  ;-)
(10:15:43 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: OK
(10:16:25 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: I am still working on Navier-Stokes with Botnner and Eucken
(10:16:41 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: and I have questions about the conductivity used in each equation
(10:16:57 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: its Nitrogen dissociation
(10:18:13 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: For the continuity equation, we need to calculate the species diffusion flux, Ds, that comes from assumption of constant Lewis number: 
Ds= Le * k_mix/(rho*Cp)
(10:19:00 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: where k_mix is the conductivity of the mixture calculated using Wilke mixing rule
(10:20:25 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: page 23 of the model documentation gives 3 of the four modes of conductivity: k_trans, k_rot and k_vib
(10:20:39 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: and Paul has helped me to find out k_el
(10:21:24 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: and we concluded that k = k_trans + k_rot + k_vib +k_el
(10:21:44 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: here is the problem:
(10:22:06 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Hmm... we really need to update p23
(10:22:27 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Not just to include k_s^el, but also to specify *which* of those two k_s^vib options we're using.
(10:22:40 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: yes
(10:22:46 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: but there is something else:
(10:22:56 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: Ben only uses k_mix = k_trans + k_rot in the code
(10:23:26 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: let me find the lines for you
(10:24:23 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: /physics/properties/transport.C lines 486 and 519
(10:26:09 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: so, basically, k_mix = wilke_mixing(k_tr_s)
(10:27:18 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: he does calculate kv_mix  = wilke_mixing (_kv) and kel_mix = wilke_mixing (_kel), but if I understood right, that is because he will call:
(10:27:30 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms:    * @returns the vibrational/electronic thermal conductivity of the mixture.
    */
      Real k_ve () const { libmesh_assert(this->_control.Physics__Chemistry__n_energies == 2); 
	                   return (_kv_mix + _kel_mix); }
(10:27:56 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Hmm... what we ought to be doing in thermal nonequilibrium is adding everything in to k for the total energy equation, but then only using k_vib+k_el for the e_v equation
(10:29:42 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: I see that, because of Equation 5.5 (page 17 of documentation); q= k nabla T + k_V nabla T_V
(10:30:25 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Yeah, it's looking like the documentation is right and the code is wrong.
(10:30:54 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: but wait, let me look at some things
(10:31:02 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: sure :)
(10:32:52 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Effectively k in the documentation and in the code is what I would have referred to as k_tr, but it is consistent between the two.  The question is whether it's what we want to be using in equation 5.55, and I believe the answer to that is "no".
(10:34:19 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: so, wait
(10:34:43 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: did you finish your lunch?
(10:34:49 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: I coudl used a call now
(10:34:56 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Didn't even get started
(10:34:58 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: go ahead and call
(10:44:43 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: Roy, can I create a ticket about that, so we don't forget it and I receive the updates, when they happen?
(10:45:08 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Yes, I was just about to do that; go right ahead
(10:45:55 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: It looks like a one-line fix, though: just add k_vib_s+k_el_s to the push_back on transport.C:497
(10:46:10 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Just need to confirm with Ben that that's the right fix.
(10:46:36 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: yes :)
(10:47:24 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: I still want to create it ;) it makes me feel that my work is worth it :D
(10:48:54 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Please do
(10:51:17 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: Damn, wait, that can't be the right fix.  If we do that, we'll be multiplying the wrong gradients in the thermal conductivity fluxes.
(10:51:23 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: you, Ben and or Paul may need to also include a k_tr_mix, in or
(10:51:24 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: yes
(10:51:30 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: that's what I was going to say
(10:51:39 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: for the heat flux
(10:51:49 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: I will add it there as well
(10:51:50 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: So yeah, I think a k_tr_mix is the way to go.
(11:06:59 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: Roy, I did it, but it was on the MASA one...
(11:07:12 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: I guess I don't have access to FINS project :(

(11:07:47 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: if that isn't good enough, go ahead and create the right ticket
(11:09:25 AM) pecos@conference.ices.utexas.edu/roystgnr: It got CC'ed to Ben, which is the important thing.
(11:10:02 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: thanks Roy!

subject	Re: URGENT: missing vib/el terms in k?
On Fri, 19 Aug 2011, Roy Stogner wrote:

    In transport.C:497, we add only the translational/rotational terms to
    k, and save the vibrational/electronic terms for kv and kel.  But then
    elsewhere in the code we're assuming that k includes the entire suite
    of thermal conductivities!  Kemelli noticed the problem when reading
    through the CONSTANT_LEWIS_NUMBER code: because _k_mix is "really"
    _k_tr_mix, the mass diffusivity coefficients in the thermal
    nonequilibrium case will be too small.


This still looks like a problem to me.


    We've also got a related
    problem throughout fluxes.C: the total energy flux really ought to
    include *both* the k_tr*dT/dx term that's already in there *and* the
    k_ve*dTv/dx term that is currently only going in to the e_ve flux.


This isn't a problem, just a false alarm.  Paul pointed out the code I
was missing that does add the k_ve flux in properly.


    I think the solution is to add a real k_tr to SpeciesViscosity,
    _k_tr_mix to MixtureTransport, etc, and then use those as appropriate
    for the diffusivity and flux calculations.


This is no longer the most obvious way to do things in the short term;
I'm now thinking that merely doing an "if (NE==2)" quick fix in the
CONSTANT_LEWIS_NUMBER code would be the best way to incorporate k_ve
if appropriate.

(11:40:03 AM) Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms: I don't know how much I should know about it, but it is better more than less, I guess ;)
